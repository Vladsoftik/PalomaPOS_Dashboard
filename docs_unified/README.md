# Unified Documentation

## Overview

This folder contains **universal documentation patterns** that are reusable across all React + Vite + TypeScript projects. These patterns, guidelines, and best practices can be applied to any frontend project using this tech stack.

## Purpose

The unified documentation provides:
- **Reusable Patterns** - Component architecture, styling, and development patterns
- **Universal Guidelines** - Best practices applicable to any project
- **Standard Approaches** - Consistent development workflow across projects
- **Reference Material** - Quick reference for common frontend development tasks

## Documentation Files

### Development Patterns

- **[Frontend Development](FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Component architecture, reusable components, and development patterns
- **[Project Structure](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)** - Folder structure, file organization, and naming conventions
- **[Best Practices](BEST_PRACTICES.md)** - Development best practices, code quality, and patterns

### Styling & Design

- **[UI Design](UI_DESIGN.md)** - UI themes, color specifications, and design requirements
- **[Styling Guidelines](STYLING_GUIDELINES.md)** - CSS/Tailwind rules, dark mode requirements, and component styling patterns

### Technical Implementation

- **[Tech Stack](TECH_STACK.md)** - Technology stack details, dependencies, and configuration requirements
- **[Routing](ROUTING.md)** - Routing structure and navigation patterns
- **[State Management](STATE_MANAGEMENT.md)** - State management approach and patterns
- **[Testing](TESTING.md)** - Testing strategies and guidelines
- **[Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Deployment process and configuration

### Development Tools

- **[Cursor Best Practices](CURSOR_BEST_PRACTICES.md)** - Guidelines for working with Cursor AI, documentation-first workflow, and prompting strategies

## Usage

These documentation files can be:
- **Copied** to other projects as a starting point
- **Referenced** when setting up new projects
- **Adapted** to specific project needs
- **Extended** with project-specific patterns

## Key Principles

All unified documentation follows these principles:

1. **Universal Applicability** - Patterns work for any React + Vite + TypeScript project
2. **No Project-Specific Logic** - No business logic or project-specific details
3. **Reusable Patterns** - Component and code patterns that can be reused
4. **Best Practices** - Industry-standard approaches and guidelines
5. **Latest Standards** - Always use latest stable packages and modern patterns

## Integration with Project Documentation

When using this unified documentation in a project:

1. **Copy** relevant files to your project's `docs/` or `docs_unified/` folder
2. **Reference** from project-specific documentation
3. **Extend** with project-specific patterns in `docs_project/` folder
4. **Update** as needed for your project's requirements

## Maintenance

- Keep unified documentation **generic** and **reusable**
- Avoid project-specific details
- Update patterns based on community best practices
- Ensure compatibility with latest stable package versions
